<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I’m currently a PhD student at the [ECE department](https://ece.illinois.edu/) of [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). My advisor is [Prof. Yoram Bresler](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/ybresler). I’m interested in machine learning, signal/image processing, computational imaging, computer vision, and inverse problems. I received my B.Sc. from [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) in [Electrical Engineering](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/) and my MS degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
